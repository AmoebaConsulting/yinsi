#NOTES
#replacements:
#lets say we wanted to say:
#"the future of our civilization depends on this:"
#
#we could break it apart like so:
#
#'1.the future'  '2.of our'  '3.civilization' '4.depends' '5.on this'
#'1the future'  '2of our'  '3civilization' '4depends' '5on this'
#i'll come up with more methods

#? is it possible to break each sentence in a way that there is only one plausible assembly ?
